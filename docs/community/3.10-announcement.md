# Django REST framework 3.10


* Reworked OpenAPI schema generation.
* Python 3 only.


## OpenAPI Schema Generation.

Since we first introduced schema support in Django REST Framework 3.5, OpenAPI has emerged as the widely adopted standard for modelling Web APIs.

This release deprecates the old CoreAPI based schema generation, and introduces improved OpenAPI schema generation in its place.

### Deprecating CoreAPI Schema Generation.

The in-built docs that were introduced in Django REST Framework v3.5 were built on CoreAPI. These are now deprecated. You may continue to use them but they will be **removed in Django REST Framework v 3.12**.

You should migrate to using the new OpenAPI based schema generation as soon as you can.


We have removed the old documentation for the CoreAPI based schema generation.
You may view them from here:

TOOD: Insert links:

* Tutorial 7: Schemas & client libraries
* Section from Documenting your API topic page.
    * Includes API reference for `include_docs_urls()` and supporting functions.
* Schemas API Guide reference.

**TODO**:
- Currently, `SchemaView` will keep working.
    - Hardcoded generator class.
- `generateschema` won't work... Do we need to fix that?
    - Only introduced in v3.9. Not really useful for `coreapi`?
- Note on (â‰ˆprivate) import changes.
    - Documented utility imports from `schemas` should be maintained.
    - Sub-imports can move for the code changes.
